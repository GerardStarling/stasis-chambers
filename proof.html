#####The doctor calls you in with a flat, monotonal voice like a butcher calling out a  numbered ticket. They rattle off questions, staring at the computer monitor the whole time, avoiding eye contact. The doctor suggests you should get a blood test and says if you leave now can probably still make it before they close for the day.

One of the users mentions a specialist. You have to re-read the post a couple of times after seeing they are located a short drive from your house. You dial the number and are greeted by a friendly voice, who listens to you explain your situation. The voice is warm and understanding. They tell you that they also suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and that this specialist has helped them to be able to live a happy life. Swallowing back the huge ball of overwhelming emotion, you book the next available appointment, walk over to the calendar and mark the date with a big X.

You know so because you cannot yet hear the sounds of the homing pigeons. The sweet smell of wattle drifts through the open window, and that new, yet familiar feeling throughout your body makes it feel like It's going to be another good day. You are a month in at your new job, and you feel that you're ready to jump out of bed and enjoy the sunshine forecasted for today.

##### You slide out of bed, into the brand new pair of Moccassins you purchased as a milestone celebration since your first appointment. You are coming to terms with what you have learned, knowing that there is not yet any cure for your illness, but all the management stratergies you have learned, in combination with the compound vitamins your new doctor has prescribed you has left you with a strength you never knew was possible. You remember to email your new friend at the forum, thanking them for the recommendation, and check to see if they're still on for this weekend.

The house is sparkling from the deep clean you did yesterday. You place the kettle atop the stove, apreciating the Currawong perusing your freshly mowed lawn. The fresh smell off coffee snakes through the air behind you as you take it in to Rose, kissing her on the forehead before you leave for work. You stand at the front door, and take a breath of the fresh air before [[stepping outside]]

There is a sensation in your body that is in addition to the pain and desperation. The dusty ray of light is beaming across the room in the same way that it usually does at this time, but at the far corner of the room it has illuminated your laptop  on top of your desk.
